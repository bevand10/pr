<h2>Progressive Relaxation</h2>
<h4>Are the lights dimmed?</h4>
<p>
Find a comfortable position with your arms resting loosly in your lap, legs uncrossed.
Notice your weight sinking into the chair and just let yourself start to unwind.
Take a couple of deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Let your muscles slowly relax as you gently close your eyes.
</p>
<p>
If you find your mind wanders during the session, gently bring your attention back to your breathing.
</p>
<p>
We will make a start by rolling your neck gently from side to side to loosen your muscles.
Raise your shoulders up to your ears, and now let the weight of your shoulders fall gently back down.
Focus on your breathing, in through your nose, and out through your mouth.
Breathe slowly and gently.
Let yourself relax.
Imagine that each time you breathe out, you let go of some of the tension.
</p>
<p>
Now we are going to turn all of our attention to your feet.
Take a moment to think about how they feel.
Keeping your heels firmly on the ground, tighen those muscles by raising your feet up a little bit, and point your toes up toward the ceiling.
Feel the tension in your calves, feet and toes.
Notice that tension and the tightness in your muscles.
Hold it, and now gently let it go.
Let the tension melt away, to be replaced by a feeling of relaxation.
Think about the changing sensations in your muscles, as they change from a tense state, to a more relaxed one.
Relax your feet and toes, and focus on how that feels as you breathe gently in and out.
</p>
<p>
Now for your legs.
Tighten your hip and leg muscles by pressing down through your heels.
You should feel the tension in your calves and in your upper legs.
Focus on that tension and tightness.
Hold it, and now relax.
Feel the tension draining out of your legs, and being replaced by a comfortable feeling of relaxation.
Imagine those muscles smoothing out, becoming soft and relaxed.
Focus on the relaxation as the tension just slips away.
</p>
<p>
Moving up to your tummy.
Tighten your tummy muscles as much as you can.
Hold that tension.
Now relax, allowing your muscles to go limp and loose.
Let the sensation spread slowly and gently over your abdomen.
Keep your attention focused on the feeling of calm relaxation.
</p>
<p>
Now for your chest.
Take a deep breath in through your nose.
Feel the tension around your ribs.
Breathe out gently and slowly - feel the changes in your chest as you breathe out.
Now breathe in deeply, filling your lungs, noticing the tension, and now release it, breathing out through your mouth.
Let your chest muscles relax, and return to slow, gentle, breathing.
Focus on the feeling of relaxation.
</p>
<p>
Now for your arms.
Create tension by pressing your hands down on the side of the chair as hard as you can, so you feel that tightness and tension.
Hold for a moment, and now let it go.
Let your hands rest in your lap, gently and comfortably, and allow the tension to slip away.
Focus on the feeling of relaxation.
</p>
<p>
Now turn your attention to your hands and forearms.
Place your hands palms up.
Squeeze them into fists as tightly as you can, and turn your fists toward the ceiling.
Feel the tension in your fingers, palms and forearms.
Hold it for a moment, and now let it go.
Slowly and gently let your hands and arms relax in your lap.
Let the relaxation spread over your arms, hands and fingers as the tension drains away.
</p>
<p>
Now focus on your shoulders.
Just take a moment to notice any tension already there.
Pull your shoulders up toward your ears, just as if there is string pulling them up.
Hold that position, noticing the tightness and tension.
Now slowly relax, letting the weight of your shoulders gently drop back down.
Focus on the feeling of relaxation in your shoulders.
</p>
<p>
Now move your attention to your jaw and mouth.
Clench your teeth and pull your mouth into a forced smile.
Your lips, cheeks and jaw should feel very tense and tight.
Hold for a moment.
Now let that tension go - feel your muscles loosen and become soft.
Allow your teeth to part, and your tongue soften and relax.
Let that relaxation spread across your jaw and mouth - focus on that feeling.
</p>
<p>
Now focus on your eyes and nose.
Close your eyes as tightly as you can, and wrinkle up your nose.
Feel the tension in your upper cheeks and eyes.
Focus on the tension - and now relax.
Notice the tension slipping away, and imagine your muscles becoming smooth and relaxed.
</p>
<p>
Now you have reached your forehead.
Raise your eyebrows as high as you can.
Notice the tension in your forehead and scalp.
Hold for a moment - and now let go.
Feel the relaxation spread back from your forehead, all the way across your scalp.
</p>
<p>
Continue to quietly relax, breathing in through your nose, and out through your mouth.
Allow yourself to become even more relaxed.
Each time you breathe out, think of a part of your body, and then allow your muscles to relax even more.
</p>
<p>
Now I'm going to leave you for a while to enjoy this feeling of relaxation - the sensation of quiet, and rest.
</p>
<p>
I'm now going to bring this session to a close.
Gently bring your thoughts back into the room.
When you're ready, slowly open your eyes.
