<h2>Progressive Relaxation</h2>
<h4>Are the lights dimmed?</h4>
<p>
Find a comfortable position with your arms resting loosly in your lap, legs uncrossed.
Notice your weight sinking into the chair and just let yourself start to unwind.
Take a couple of deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Let your muscles slowly relax as you gently close your eyes.
</p>
<p>
If you find your mind wanders during the session, gently bring your attention back to your breathing.
</p>
<p>
Now we will make a start by rolling your neck gently from side to side to loosen your muscles,
and then raise your shoulders up to your ears, then let the weight of your shoulders fall gently back down.
Focus on your breathing, in through your nose, and out through your mouth.
Breathe slowly and gently.
Let yourself relax, imagine that each time you breathe out, you let go of some of the tension.
</p>
<p>
Now we are going to turn all of our attention to your feet and take a moment to think about how they feel.
Keeping your heels firmly on the ground, tighen those muscles by raising your feet up a little bit and pointing your toes up toward the ceiling.
Feel the tension in your calves, feet and toes.
Notice that tension and the tightness in your muscles, hold it, and gently let it go.
Let the tension melt away to be replaced by a feeling of relaxation.
Think about the changing sensations in your muscles as they change from a tense state to a more relaxed one.
Relax your feet and toes and focus on how that feels as you breathe gently in and out.
</p>
<p>
Now for your legs.
Tighten your hip and leg muscles by pressing down through your heels.
You should feel the tension in your calves and in your upper legs.
Focus on that tension and tightness, hold it, and relax.
Feel the tension draining out of your lets and being replaced by a comfortable feeling of relaxation.
Imagine those muscles smoothing out, becoming soft and relaxed.
Focus on the relaxation as the tension just slips away.
</p>
<p>
Moving up to your tummy.
Tighten your tummy muscles as much as you can, hold that tension, and then relax, allowing the muscles to go limp and loose.
Let the sensation spread slowly and gently over your abdomen.
Keep your attention focused on the feeling of calm relaxation.
</p>
<p>
Now for your chest.
Take a deep breath in through your nose.
Feel the tension around your ribs, breathe out gently and slowly, and feel the changes in your chest as you breathe out.
Breathe in deeply, filling your lungs, noticing the tension, and then release it, breathing out through your mouth.
Let your chest muscles relax, and return to slow, gentle, breathing.
Focus on the feeling of relaxation.
</p>
<p>
Now for your arms.
Create tension by pressing your hands down on the side of the chair as hard as you can, so you feel that tightness and the tension.
Hold it and then let it go.
Let your hands rest in your lap, gently and comfortably, and allow the tension to slip away.
Focus on the feeling of relaxation.
