<h1>Progressive Relaxation</h1>
<h2>Are the lights dimmed?</h2>
<p>
Find a comfortable position with your arms resting loosly in your lap, legs uncrossed.
Notice your weight sinking into the chair and just let yourself start to unwind.
Take a couple of deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Let your muscles slowly relax as you gently close your eyes.
</p>
<p>
If you find your mind wanders during the session, gently bring your attention back to your breathing.
