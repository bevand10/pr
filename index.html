<h2>Progressive Relaxation</h2>
<h4>Are the lights dimmed?</h4>
<p>
Find a comfortable position with your arms resting loosly in your lap, legs uncrossed.
Notice your weight sinking into the chair and just let yourself start to unwind.
Take a couple of deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Let your muscles slowly relax as you gently close your eyes.
</p>
<p>
If you find your mind wanders during the session, gently bring your attention back to your breathing.
</p>
<p>
Now we will make a start by rolling your neck gently from side to side to loosen your muscles,
and then raise your shoulders up to your ears, then let the weight of your shoulders fall gently back down.
Focus on your breathing, in through your node, and out through your mouth.
Breathe slowly and gently.
Let yourself relax, imagine that each time you breathe out, you let go of some of the tension.
